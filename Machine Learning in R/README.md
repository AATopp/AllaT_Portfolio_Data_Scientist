# Machine_Learning_R
In this Repository I am going to introduce my machine learning projects performed in R as part of deliverables in Data Science Graduate Program at Regis University.
The projects are based on a few ML algorithms, such as Naive Bayes(NB), Decision Trees/ Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Artificial Neural Network(ANN), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and K-Means/Hierarchical Clustering(HCA). 


Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning involves algorithms that
learn to solve problems based on sample data, observations, experiences or environments rather
than explicit programing instructions. Machine learning algorithms automatically learn and
generalize from data with no human interventions.

## Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into 3 main groups:
* Supervised Learning 
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning 

## Choosing a ML algorithm
* Classification (supervised learning)
Machine learning algorithms that can be used are Na√Øve Bayes, decision Trees, nearest
Neighbor, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM), etc.,
* Numeric prediction (supervised learning)
The algorithms include linear regression, KNN regression, regression tress, artificial
neural network, and support vector machine, etc.,
* Clustering (unsupervised learning)
The most common algorithm is K-means.
* Pattern Detection (unsupervised learning)
The common method is association rules.
