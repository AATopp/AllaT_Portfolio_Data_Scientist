# Top Data Science Projects 

I would love to showcase the projects I have been working on in the last 2 years during my graduate program in Data Science including some of my personal projects I have been working on afterwards:

* ### Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas (Adult dataset)
In this project I focused on exploring my 'Adult" dataset to get to know the data before applying data analysis and machine learning models. I am answering important questions during EDA for better data visualization.  
* ### API Projects: NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day and NOOAAs weather API 
In these two projects I wanted to showcase how I use work with APIs. I could collect data from two sources with public data avalable NASA`s pictues of the day and NOOAA weather. 
* ### Analysing Movies dataset with Pandas and SQLite

* ### Feature Engineering California House Prices with Pandas 

* ### Data Science Practicum - Data Engineering project

* ### Data Cleansing
