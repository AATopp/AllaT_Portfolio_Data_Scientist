# 5 top Data Science Projects 

I would love to showcase the projects I have been working on in the last 2 years during my graduate program in Data Science including some of my personal projects I have been working on afterwards:

* ### [Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/blob/main/Pandas%20Projects/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Adult%20data%20set/Adult%20EDA%20in%20Pandas.ipynb) (Adult dataset)
In this project I focused on exploring my 'Adult" dataset to get to know the data before applying data analysis and machine learning models. I am answering important questions during EDA for better data visualization.  
* ### API Projects: [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling%20in%20Python/NASA%20Astronomy%20Picture%20of%20the%20Day%20(APOD).ipynb) and [NOOAAs weather API](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling%20in%20Python/NOAAs%20weather%20API.ipynb) 
In these two projects I wanted to showcase how I work with APIs in Python without using Pandas. I could collect data from two sources with public data avalable NASA`s pictues of the day and NOOAA weather. 
* ### [Analyzing Movies dataset with Pandas and SQLite](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/Movies%20Analysis%20with%20Pandas%20and%20SQLite.ipynb)
In this project I wanted to showcase my SQL knowlege in Python and quering data. I created an SQLite database, loaded data from DataFrames into an SQLite database and from SQLite into DataFrame, and performed simple queries with joins.
* ### [Feature Engineering California House Prices with Pandas](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/blob/main/Pandas%20Projects/California%20House%20Prices%20with%20Pandas/California%20House%20Prices%20with%20Pandas.ipynb) 
In this complex project I cleaned data and created additional features, visualized house pricing in California using matplotlib and seaborn, trained random forest regression model and evaluated the model on the test set.
* ### Data Science Practicum - [Data Engineering project](https://github.com/AATopp/AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/tree/main/Cloud%20Project%20Capstone%20Regis)
In this ongoing project I had a chance to work with 8 GB dataset from of Yelp Reviews to use for Virtual Machine performance using PostgreSQL database and Linux environment. The whole process of the project is listed on its page. 
* ### Data Cleansing
