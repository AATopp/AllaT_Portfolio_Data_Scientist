# Top Data Science Projects 

I would love to showcase the projects I have been working on in the last 2 years during my graduate program in Data Science including some of my personal projects I have been working on afterwards:

* ### Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas (Adult dataset)
In this project I focused on exploring my 'Adult" dataset to get to know the data before applying data analysis and machine learning models. I am answering important questions during EDA for better data visualization.  
* ### API Projects: NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day and NOOAAs weather API 
In these two projects I wanted to showcase how I work with APIs in Python without using Pandas. I could collect data from two sources with public data avalable NASA`s pictues of the day and NOOAA weather. 
* ### Analysing Movies dataset with Pandas and SQLite
In this project I wanted to showcasw my SQL knowlege in Python and quering data. I created an SQLite database, loaded data from DataFrames into an SQLite database and from SQLite into DataFrame, and performed simple queries with joins.
* ### Feature Engineering California House Prices with Pandas 
In this complex project I cleaned data and created additional features, visualized house pricing in California using matplotlib and seaborn, trained random forest regression model and evaluated the model on the test set.
* ### Data Science Practicum - Data Engineering project
In this ongoing project I had a chance to work with 8 GB dataset from of Yelp Reviews to use for Virtual Machine performance using PostgreSQL database and Linux environment. The whole process of the project is listed on its page. 
* ### Data Cleansing
