# COVID-19 Data Interconnection Project

The aim of this project is to connect key data points around the spread of sars-cov-2, commonly known as the disease COVID-19. Key data points include cases, deaths, and hospitalization utilization rates, by state and day. Daily cases and deaths are well-maintained by the New York Times; daily hospitalization utilization rates are maintained by the Center for Disease Control. This repository contains the code necessary to create the final joined dataset, as well as the final dataset. 

### Prerequisites

Python3 is recommended. If you would like to run the Jupyter notebook, be sure you have [installed Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) beforehand. 

## Running the code

When you're ready, open your preferred python IDE and navigate to the project directory. Launch jupyter notebook and choose the project name. Everything should run automatically. As an example, from terminal:

```python
> terminal
cd('/.../AllaT_Portfolio_Data_Scientist/COVID19_Data_Interconnection_Project')
jupyter notebook
Data_interchange_project_.ipynb

```

## Expected Output

The code generates the combined dataset and downloads it under the name 'final_covid.csv'
