The aim of this project is 

### Prerequisites

Python3 is recommended. If you would like to run the Jupyter notebook, be sure you have [installed Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) beforehand. The easiest way would be to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) because it has python3 with all its packages included and Jupyter notebook as well.

## Running the code

#### Jupyter (Anaconda)

When working in Jupyter through Anaconda, just launch the Jupyter app from your computer and upload the file Data_interchange_project_.ipynb from your computer, open it and run it.

## Expected Output

The code generates the combined dataset and downloads it under the name 'policy_final.csv' and 'COVID_policy_data'
