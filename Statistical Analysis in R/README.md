## Statistical Analysis and Experimental design.

This folder contains my statistical analysis projects where I examined the statistical techniques of creating models from data using linear regression and multiple linear regression. 
In addition, there is an examination determining the statistical variability between populations using ANOVA and exploration techniques for formulating hypothesis about data for testing and for new data collection and experiments.
